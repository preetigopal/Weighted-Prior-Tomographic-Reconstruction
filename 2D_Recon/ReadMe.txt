This directory contains scripts for 2D reconstruction of Liver and serves only as an example for measuring the compute times for various stages of weighted-prior reconstruction as specified in Section.7(2) of the paper. 

Below are the instructions to use the scripts here:

Requirements:
Matlab 2019 or later version

Command for running the scripts:
For reconstructing, run `driver.m` with the argument `tmh_7`, i.e.,

> driver('tmh_7')

Reconstruction results can be viewed within the generated 'results' directory.
