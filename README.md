# Weighted-Prior-Tomographic-Reconstruction

This code repository is part of the following work which has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging for peer review.

Title: "Eliminating object prior-bias from sparse-projection tomographic reconstructions"

Authors: Preeti Gopal, Sharat Chandran, Imants Svalbe and Ajit Rajwade

This codebase is for 2D reconstruction of Liver and serves only as an example for measuring the compute times for various stages of weighted-prior reconstruction as specified in Section.7B of the paper. 

Below are the instructions to use the scripts here:

Requirements: Matlab 2019 or later version

Command:  For reconstructing, run `driver.m` with the argument `tmh_7`, i.e.,

> driver('tmh_7')

Reconstruction results can be viewed within the generated 'results' directory.

Data and scripts for reconstructing other datasets will be made
available after the review process is complete.
