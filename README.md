This code repository is part of the following work which has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging for peer review.

Title: "Mitigating object prior-bias from sparse-projection tomographic reconstructions"

Authors: Preeti Gopal, Sharat Chandran, Imants Svalbe and Ajit Rajwade

This codebase has 2 independent parts: 2D_recon and 3D_recon, with scripts for 2D and 3D reconstructions respectively.

Please follow the instructions in ReadMe.txt within each directory for running the scripts.
