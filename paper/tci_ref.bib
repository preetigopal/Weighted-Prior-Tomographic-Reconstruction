abstract = "In this paper, a framework to create a statistical content-adapted sampling (SCAS) for 3D X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is introduced. SCAS aims at providing an accurate but light reconstruction volume. Based on decision theory, the 3D reconstruction space is sampled from the raw projection data in three steps to directly fit the sample. To do so, the structural information is first extracted from the projections by edge detection. This information is then merged in the reconstruction space, providing a pointcloud which accurately delineates the 3D interfaces of the specimen. From this pointcloud, a 3D mesh, closely fitting the shape of the studied object, is finally built via constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization. To assess the potential of the proposed SCAS for CT imaging, an iterative reconstruction was performed by classical Ordered Subset Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (OS-SART) – with fitting projection operator. The SCAS was evaluated on both numerical and experimental data. Results show that the use of statistical testing enabled the design of a robust, automated and fast method to build accurate pointclouds from a limited number of projections. The 3D meshes generated from these pointclouds are composed of few cells when compared to the regular voxel representation, leading to a downsize in computational cost and achieving up to 90\% of memory footprint reduction. Simulations showed that performed reconstruction on such meshes provide accurate description of the object due to the finer sampling at interfaces."}

abstract = "In X-ray tomography, a number of radiographs (projections) are recorded from which a tomogram is then reconstructed. Conventionally, these projections are acquired equiangularly, resulting in an unbiased sampling of the Radon space. However, especially in case when only a limited number of projections can be acquired, the selection of the angles has a large impact on the quality of the reconstructed image. In this paper, a dynamic algorithm is proposed, in which new projection angles are selected by maximizing the information gain about the object, given the set of possible new angles. Experiments show that this approach can select projection angles for which the accuracy of the reconstructed image is significantly higher compared to the standard angle selections schemes."

abstract = {Iterative methods are now recognized as powerful tools to solve inverse problems such as tomographic reconstruction. 
In this paper, the main goal is to present a new reconstruction algorithm made from two components. An iterative algorithm, namely the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method, is used to solve the tomographic problem 
in the least square (LS) sense for our specific discrete Mojette geometry. 
The results are compared (with the same geometry) to the corresponding Mojette Filtered Back Projection (FBP) method. 

In the fist part of the paper, we recall the discrete geometry used to define the projection M and backprojection M* operators. In the second part, the CG algorithm is presented within the context of the Mojette 
geometry. Noise is then added onto these Mojette projections with respect to the sampling and reconstructions are performed.
Finally the Toeplitz block Toeplitz (TBT) character of M*M is demonstrated.},

journal="Medical {\&} Biological Engineering {\&} Computing",
year="2016",
pages="1--16",
abstract="Dual-dictionary learning (Dual-DL) method utilizes both a low-resolution dictionary and a high-resolution dictionary, which are co-trained for sparse coding and image updating, respectively. It can effectively exploit a priori knowledge regarding the typical structures, specific features, and local details of training sets images. The prior knowledge helps to improve the reconstruction quality greatly. This method has been successfully applied in magnetic resonance (MR) image reconstruction. However, it relies heavily on the training sets, and dictionaries are fixed and nonadaptive. In this research, we improve Dual-DL by using self-adaptive dictionaries. The low- and high-resolution dictionaries are updated correspondingly along with the image updating stage to ensure their self-adaptivity. The updated dictionaries incorporate both the prior information of the training sets and the test image directly. Both dictionaries feature improved adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently and significantly improve the quality and robustness of MR image reconstruction.",

@article{lasso,
 ISSN = {00359246},
 abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},
